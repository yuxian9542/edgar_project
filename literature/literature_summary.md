## Summary
The paper titled "Company Similarity using Large Language Models" by Dimitrios Vamvourellis et al. addresses the critical financial task of identifying companies with similar business profiles. This task is fundamental for analysts to benchmark firms, construct portfolios, attribute risk, and conduct relative valuation. Traditional approaches rely heavily on predefined industry classification systems such as the Global Industry Classification System (GICS), which assigns companies to discrete categories based on their principal business activities. However, these classifications have limitations: they are rigid, fail to capture companies operating across multiple sectors, and do not provide a quantitative ranking of similarity among firms. Moreover, inconsistencies exist across data vendors in assigning classification codes, further complicating peer group identification.

To overcome these challenges, the authors explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate company embeddings derived from textual business descriptions found in SEC 10-K filings, specifically the Item 1 Business Description section. This textual data provides detailed insights into a company’s products, markets, and competitive landscape, offering a rich source of information beyond structured financial data. The study leverages pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs to learn embeddings that capture nuanced relationships between companies. The authors benchmark these embeddings against traditional GICS classifications and evaluate their effectiveness through various machine learning and financial metrics, including return correlations.

Key findings indicate that company embeddings generated by LLMs can effectively reproduce GICS classifications and provide a meaningful quantitative measure of similarity. Importantly, companies deemed similar by the embeddings also exhibit similarity in financial performance metrics, suggesting that the textual embeddings capture economically relevant information. This approach offers a more flexible and granular alternative to rigid classification systems, enabling analysts to rank and compare companies based on learned semantic features rather than fixed categories. The paper also situates this work within the broader literature, contrasting it with prior methods that use structured data, co-occurrence in news, or network-based embeddings, highlighting the advantages of leveraging natural language processing techniques on rich textual disclosures.

In summary, this research demonstrates the potential of large language models to enhance company similarity analysis by learning embeddings from detailed business descriptions in regulatory filings. This method addresses the limitations of traditional industry classifications, providing a scalable and data-driven approach to identifying peer groups in finance. The findings have practical implications for portfolio construction, risk management, and relative valuation, and open avenues for further exploration of NLP techniques in financial analytics.

## Methodology
The methodology of this research involves constructing company embeddings from textual business descriptions in SEC 10-K filings using state-of-the-art (SOTA) natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and evaluating these embeddings on multiple downstream financial tasks. The key components of the methodology are as follows:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Data Source: The study uses textual data from Item 1 (Business Description section) of SEC 10-K filings for 2590 companies from the Russell 3000 universe for the year 2022.
   - Data Characteristics: Each Item 1 section contains about 1500-1800 words describing principal products, securities, competitive factors, distribution methods, and markets of operation.
   - Preprocessing Steps: Standard NLP preprocessing is applied including removal of URLs, non-ASCII characters, and whitespace normalization. Text is lowercased and tokenized using the BERT-base-uncased tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 30,000 tokens.

2. **Embedding Models and Fine-tuning:**
   - Models Used:
     - **BERT-base-uncased:** Pretrained Transformer model fine-tuned on the task of predicting GICS industry classification using the first 512 tokens of Item 1 text. Fine-tuning uses a softmax layer of 66 dimensions (number of GICS industries).
     - **Sentence-BERT (SBERT):** Uses a siamese/triplet network architecture to generate sentence/document embeddings optimized for semantic similarity. Both pretrained and fine-tuned versions are used. Fine-tuning is done on pairs of business descriptions labeled as same/different GICS industry using cosine similarity loss.
     - **Longformer:** Transformer model optimized for longer documents (up to 4096 tokens) using local and global attention mechanisms. Fine-tuned on GICS industry classification using either 512 or 1024 tokens.
     - **GPT-based embeddings (text-embedding-ada-002):** Large generative pretrained transformer model generating 1536-dimensional embeddings, used without fine-tuning.
     - **PaLM-based embeddings:** Large decoder-only Transformer model generating 768-dimensional embeddings, used without fine-tuning.
   - Fine-tuning Procedure: Gradual unfreezing is applied to avoid catastrophic forgetting. Initially, only the classification layer is trained for 15 epochs with a high learning rate, followed by unfreezing all layers and training for 5 more epochs with a lower learning rate.

3. **Context Window Exploration:**
   - The effect of input text length on embedding quality is studied by generating embeddings from the first 512, 1024, and 1536 tokens of the business description.
   - For documents exceeding model context windows, chunking and averaging embeddings are employed.

4. **Computational Setup:**
   - Experiments are conducted on a high-performance computing instance with 4 Tesla T4 GPUs, 32 CPUs, and 120 GB RAM.
   - Fine-tuning routines take approximately 16 minutes for BERT, 36 minutes for SBERT, and 40-60 minutes for Longformer depending on input length.

5. **Evaluation and Analysis:**
   - **Downstream Tasks:**
     - *GICS Sector/Industry Classification:* Company embeddings are used as features in a multinomial logistic regression classifier to predict GICS sector (11 classes) and industry (66 classes). Performance metrics include accuracy, micro F1, and weighted F1 scores.
     - *Similarity Task:* The ability of embeddings to identify top peer companies is evaluated by correlating pairwise embedding cosine similarity with the correlation of daily stock returns over multiple years (2019-2022). The average pairwise correlation among top k neighbors (k=1,5,10) is computed.
     - *Return Attribution:* Clustering algorithms (k-means, agglomerative, spectral clustering) are applied to embeddings to form groups of similar companies. These clusters are used as categorical features in cross-sectional regressions to explain monthly equity returns. The R² from regressions measures how well clusters capture systematic risk factors.
   - **Clustering Evaluation Metrics:** Homogeneity, completeness, and V-measure are used to assess cluster quality.
   - **Comparison Baselines:** Traditional GICS classifications are used as benchmarks for similarity and return attribution tasks.
   - **Effect of Model Size and Fine-tuning:** The study compares large language models (PaLM, GPT) with smaller models (SBERT) and assesses the impact of fine-tuning on embedding quality across tasks.

6. **Additional Analyses:**
   - Visualization of embeddings using UMAP to identify outlier companies whose embeddings do not align with their GICS classification.
   - Use of soft classification probabilities from the fine-tuned models to represent companies as distributions over sectors/industries, capturing multifaceted business operations.

In summary, the methodology integrates advanced NLP models to generate dense numerical embeddings from textual business descriptions, fine-tunes models on industry classification tasks, and evaluates the resulting embeddings on classification accuracy, similarity to financial return correlations, and ability to explain return variation via clustering. The approach combines supervised fine-tuning, unsupervised embedding generation, and financial econometric validation to assess the effectiveness of language-model-based company representations.
